## Garbage Classification: A Comparative Analysis of Multi-Class Classification using Feature Descriptors and CNNs
A comparative analysis on machine learning and deep learning techniques for garbage classification for recycling automation.

This work is aimed at analyzing different techniques for the performance of a Multi-Calssification task, involving the classification of Garbage in 5 distinct classes: Glass, Paper, Cardboard, Plastic and Metal. The project objective is to address the classification problem using both Machine Learning and Deep Learning methods. Specifically, an initial classification will be performed using Feature Descriptors, and then the task will be performed using two CNNs, both pre-trained on ImageNet, comparing their architecture and metrics. The first CNN would be based on a MobileNet model, the second on VGG19.
